## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't rush** — Quality over quantity. Understand deeply, don't just read.
2. **Practice aloud** — Writing is not enough. Speak your answers.
3. **Time yourself** — 45 minutes goes fast. Practice under time pressure.
4. **Focus on trade-offs** — This is what separates senior engineers.
5. **Review mistakes** — After each mock, note what you'd do differently.
6. **Stay consistent** — 1-2 hours daily for 2-3 weeks is better than cramming.

**Remember**: You're not memorizing solutions. You're learning a framework for thinking about system design problems. The 11-step format works for ANY system design question.

Good luck! 🚀
